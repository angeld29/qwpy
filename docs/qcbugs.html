<h1>Bugs in QuakeC Sourcecode</h1>
<p>Before translating a QuakeC game to Python, there are a few minor bugs that 
  should be corrected in the QC source. These things must not have bothered the 
  QuakeC compiler or interpreter - but if they aren't corrected, the translated 
  Python game will behave incorrectly or raise exceptions at runtime. The line 
  numbers listed are for the source that was bundled with id's full Quake1/QuakeWorld 
  sourcecode release.</p>
<p>Any games derived from the original QuakeC deathmatch probably have these bugs 
  too. CTF for example, has all the bugs found in DM, plus a few others (line 
  numbers for CTF 4.21d source are listed in parentheses).</p>
<h2>grapple.qc (CTF only)</h2>
<h3>CTF: line 93</h3>
<p>change: <code>entity (float head) MakeLink =</code><br>
  to: <code>entity () MakeLink =</code><br>
</p>
<p>The <code>head</code> parameter isn't used, and none of the callers supply 
  it. If this isn't changed, an exception is raised at runtime, and the grapple 
  behaves incorrectly.</p>
<h2>misc.qc</h2>
<h3>line 338 (CTF: 334)</h3>
remove: <code>local vector vec;</code> 
<p>local declaration has same name as function parameter. </p>
<h3>line 594 (CTF: 595)</h3>
<p>change: <code>makestatic();</code></p>
<p>to: <code>makestatic(self);</code></p>
<p><code>makestatic</code> is declared to expect one parameter, Python isn't happy 
  when one is not supplied. If not corrected this will raise an exception at runtime. 
</p>
<h2>status.qc (CTF only)</h2>
<h3>CTF: line 178</h3>
<p>change: <code>res = TeamSetStatRes2();</code></p>
<p>to: <code>res = TeamSetStatRes2(self);</code></p>
<p><code>TeamSetStatRes2</code> expects a parameter, raises an exception at runtime 
  if not fixed.</p>
<h2>triggers.qc</h2>
<h3>line 432 (CTF: 430)</h3>
<p>change: <code>other.flags = other.flags - other.flags &amp; FL_ONGROUND;</code></p>
<p>to: <code>other.flags = other.flags - (other.flags &amp; FL_ONGROUND);</code></p>
<p>Without the parentheses, the order of evaluation of the expression for Python 
  (and most other languages including real C and Java) is such that it would always 
  evaluate to 0. If this isn't corrected, you'll see odd behavior in the game 
  such as not being able to pick up weapons after passing through a teleporter.</p>
<h2>weapons.qc</h2>
<h3>line 98 (CTF: 118)</h3>
<p>remove: <code>local vector org;</code></p>
<p> local declaration has same name as function parameter.</p>
