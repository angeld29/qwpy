<h1>Translating QuakeC to Python</h1>
<p>The QuakeC -&gt; Python translator has been tested against the deathmatch sourcecode 
  that was supplied with the Quake1/QuakeWorld source release, and CTF 4.21d. 
</p>
<p>The Python code that's produced may not be entirely optimal, but should be 
  completely runnable as long as <a href="qcbugs.html">a few minor QuakeC bugs</a> 
  are fixed first. </p>
<p><b>Usage:</b> <code>python qc2python.py</code> &lt;qc-source-dir&gt; [&lt;output-dir&gt;]</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <code>python qc2python.py f:\quake\progs py_dm</code></p>
<p>The <code>qc-source-dir</code> should be the place where your <code>progs.src</code> 
  and <code>*.qc</code> files reside. If you omit the output-dir, the translated 
  game code is placed in the qc-source-dir.</p>
<p>There is also a quick debugging mode, for translating a single QC source file 
  and outputting the result to stdout. To do this, just supply the name of a single 
  QC file instead of a qc-source-dir <i>(this was useful mostly for testing the 
  translator against small snippets of QC code to make sure various constructs 
  were converted properly)</i>.</p>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<p>The translator will print warnings if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It had to change a variable name which would conflict with a Python reserved 
    word</li>
  <li>Using an augmented assignment (+=, -=, etc) didn't seem appropriate (mostly 
    to catch one of the <a href="qcbugs.html">known QC bugs</a> in <code>triggers.qc</code>). 
    If you're translating stock DM or CTF, and have fixed the known bugs, then 
    the warnings should be ignored, since in those cases the translator is doing 
    the right thing. If you're translating some other QW mod, look at those warnings 
    closely, and you might catch a small glitch in your original QC code. </li>
  <li>A local variable has the same name as a function param or a variable in 
    a higher scope. Don't ignore these, you'll have to rename the variable in 
    QC and run the translator again.</li>
  <li>A call to a function that the translator knows should take a parameter, 
    is without one. This is only checked for a dozen or so functions that are 
    implemented in C, that the translator is trying to turn into method calls. 
    No warnings are printed for incorrect calls to QC functions - you'll have 
    to find those yourself, and should be seen at runtime through raised exceptions. 
    This is mainly to catch one of the known QC bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Translated Code</h2>
<p>Each QC source file will be translated into a single Python module. Comments 
  are retained wherever possible, and overall, the structure of the Python module 
  should be very close to the original QC file.</p>
<p>Every module starts off with two lines importing references from the <code>qwpython</code> 
  package for the QWPython runtime engine, the Vector class constructor, and the 
  QC runtime emulation object. Then, any dependencies on other translated QC modules 
  appear as <code>import</code> statements.</p>
<p>Each translated function is declared with an extra parameter: <code>*qwp_extra</code>, 
  to absorb any unexpected parameters passed to the function. QuakeC seemed to 
  ignore that sort of thing, but Python doesn't like it. Many of these are unnecessary, 
  and can be taken out - this was just a brute-force way of insuring that the 
  translated code would run right out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>If a QC function declared any local variables, those variables are initialized 
  to 0, Vector(0,0,0) or <code>engine.world</code> at the top of the function. 
  This was another brute-force way of insuring that the translated code would 
  run, since in Python, a variable doesn't exist until something is assigned to 
  it. If you are sure that any possible first reference to a variable is always 
  an assignment (even taking <code>if</code> statements and such into account), 
  then the initial assignment can probably be removed in most cases. Here's an 
  example from <code>plats.py</code>:</p>
<pre>
    def func_train_find(*qwp_extra):
        targ = engine.world
        targ = qc.find(qc.world, 'targetname', qc.self.target)
        qc.self.target = targ.target
        qc.setorigin(qc.self, targ.origin - qc.self.mins)
        if not qc.self.targetname:
            #  not triggered, so start immediately
            qc.self.nextthink = qc.self.ltime + 0.1
            qc.self.think = train_next
</pre>
<p>That first assignment of <code>engine.world</code> to <code>targ</code> is 
  unnecessary, and can be removed. A fancier translator that looked ahead and 
  analyzed the functions a bit could avoid that sort of thing - but it's relatively 
  harmless, and can be cleaned up by hand (someone <i>is</i> going to modify this 
  Python code, right? otherwise what's the point? might as well leave it in QC 
  if it isn't going to be altered).</p>
<p>At the end of each module will be an extra function to reinitialize the global 
  variables that appear in that module (for use at level changes), named <code>qwp_reset_&lt;module-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>A module named <code>__init__.py</code> is created to be the entrypoint for 
  the game, basically, it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imports all the other translated modules.</li>
  <li>Defines a reset function for the entire game, to be called on level changes.</li>
  <li>Holds a list of entity fields that QC defined for the game (not including 
    the entity fields the underlying C engine already knows about).</li>
  <li>Wraps two client connect functions to make sure that player entities have 
    values assigned to all QC declared entity fields.</li>
  <li>Registers callback functions to the underlying C engine.</li>
  <li>Starts the game running.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python for QC programmers</h2>
<p>A couple quick notes about a few key things about Python that are different 
  from QC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Vector class is immutable - you can't assign values to the individual 
    x, y, or z fields. Instead, you have to create a new vector, copying the fields 
    you don't want to change, and setting the fields that you do. For example, 
    instead of: <code>a.x = 7</code>, you'd have to write: <code>a = Vector(7, 
    a.y, a.z)</code>.</li>
  <li>To make this a bit easier, the '%' operator for Vectors is defined to be 
    sort of a merge function. So for example given vectors named 'a', and 'b': 
    <code>a % b</code> will result in a new vector set to the values (b.x, b.y, 
    b.z), but in the case of values that are <code>None</code>, the corresponding 
    field from 'a' is copied. This works as an augmented assignment, so the equivalent 
    of QC's <code>a.x = 7</code> can be written in Python as: <code>a %= Vector(7, 
    None, None)</code>. </li>
  <li>Variables in Python aren't declared, they just spring into existance when 
    something is assigned to them.</li>
  <li>Variables are typeless - the objects have a type of course, but the names 
    that refer to them don't. So any name can refer to any type.</li>
  <li>In QC (and C and Java, and most other languages), variables referred to 
    in a function are global, unless declared local. In Python it's the other 
    way around, local unless declared global. So if you have something like: 
    <pre>
    x = 1
    def foo():
        x = 2
    foo()
    print x
</pre>
    That assignment of 2 to x is to a local version of x, not the global one, 
    so the print statment will print 1, not 2. You'd have to add a '<code>global 
    x</code>' statement to the top of the function to get the global x to be set 
    to 2. You'll see this in action in the <code>qwp_reset_*</code> functions 
    at the end of each module, which are full of <code>global</code> declarations. 
    Without them, the reset functions wouldn't actually reset the global variables 
    - they would just be setting local variables of the same name</li>
</ul>
