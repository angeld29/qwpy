QWPython CHANGELOG

2001-04-15 (v1.1)

    * Added WinNT/Win2k service version of CTF. 
      Pretty straightforward, anybody should be able to 
      adapt it to other QWPython games besides CTF - nothing
      in CTF itself changed, all the magic is in the
      ctf_service.py file.
    
    * Removed C code relating to PAK files, since Python
      handles all that now.  Looked for and removed
      other dead code (probably plenty left though).
      
    * Reworked download code, so it now functions with the
      Python resource-loading code. Still a few file-io
      related bits of C code it would be nice to move up to
      Python.
      
    * Tested against Debian 2.2, found and fixed problems
      that prevented a clean compile and running under Debian
      (and presumably other Linuxes)
      
    * Changed Sys_Error() function so that it now does exit
      the game loop and raise a Python exception.  Wish I 
      could also have it include the file and linenumber of
      where in C the Sys_Error() was called.
      
    * Cleaned up Python "pakfile" module                        
    
    * Went over translated CTF, cleaned up code by hand
      since the machine translation was a little rough to
      look at (weird spacing, unnecessary assignments at the 
      tops of many functions)
